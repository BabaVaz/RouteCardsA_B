## 📝 Description  

**High-level overview**  
Route Cards is a clean, mobile-first, Apple-inspired web app that displays journeys from **Origin → Destination**.  
Users can filter by **transport mode** (Walk, Bike, Bus), toggle **“Illustrated only”**, favorite routes, and even pick a random route to explore.  

**Detailed flow**  
- The top filter panel uses radio inputs for mode and a checkbox for “Illustrated only.”  
- Below, dynamically rendered “route cards” show Origin, Destination, Mode badges, Vibes, and a Favorite button.  
- Users apply filters to show matching cards, toggle favorites, and persist everything via `localStorage`.  
- On reload, filter selections and favorites restore automatically.  
- The design mirrors iOS aesthetics — soft gray panels, SF Pro fonts, and rounded cards with subtle shadows.

## ⚙️ Feature Spec  

- **Filter Control:**  
  - “Apply filters” is disabled until a mode is chosen.  
  - Active mode label is visually highlighted.  

- **Filtering Behavior:**  
  - Only routes matching the selected mode are displayed.  
  - When “Illustrated only” is checked, filter further to `illustrated === true`.  

- **Card Rendering:**  
  - Cards are generated from the provided dataset using a `<template>`.  
  - Each card shows origin, destination, notes, mode badge, and vibes badge.  
  - Favorite button toggles pressed state.  

- **Random Route:**  
  - Picks a random route from the currently filtered list.  

- **Persistence:**  
  - Save filters and favorites to `localStorage`.  
  - Restore state on reload.
